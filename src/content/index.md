  - quote: We were thrilled to have Yvonne play at our wedding reception. She was
      easy to communicate with beforehand, so we felt confident we were in good
      hands. We had a wide range in the age of our guests and Yvonne was able to
      put a playlist together that had songs everyone knew. Our guests commented
      that having a live piano player was a really nice surprise and how much
      they enjoyed her music. It was a pleasure having Yvonne join us on our
      special day.

  - quote: Yvonne has made our church’s piano “sing” in a way we’ve never
      experienced before. With incredible musicality, she offers us postlude
      that has the entire congregation entranced and staying in the sanctuary
      until finished. Yvonne is guiding our small choir to new heights and
      brings us guests artists from her artistic circle that elevate the music
      ministry to another level.
