  - quote: We were thrilled to have Yvonne play at our wedding reception. She was
      easy to communicate with beforehand, so we felt confident we were in good
      hands. We had a wide range in the age of our guests and Yvonne was able to
      put a playlist together that had songs everyone knew. Our guests commented
      that having a live piano player was a really nice surprise and how much
      they enjoyed her music. It was a pleasure having Yvonne join us on our
      special day.

      experienced before. With incredible musicality, she offers us postludes

    position: Cawthra Park Chamber Choir, Resonance, Raising Voices
  - quote: At age 11 my dad asked me if I wanted to learn to play the piano.
      Influenced by my older sister I said no, and I regretted it until I was 58
      when I decided I really want to learn. I was so lucky to have met Yvonne
      as my piano teacher. Her incredible patience and her passion for the piano
      really helped me grow my passion for the instrument. I learned to love
      many of the classic composers like Beethoven, Debussy, Ravel, Satie and
      many more. Now retired I have a hobby that will stay with me forever.
      Thanks to Yvonne
