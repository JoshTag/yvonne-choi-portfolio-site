  - quote: We were thrilled to have Yvonne play at our wedding reception. She was
      easy to communicate with beforehand, so we felt confident we were in good
      hands. We had a wide range in the age of our guests and Yvonne was able to
      put a playlist together that had songs everyone knew. Our guests commented
      that having a live piano player was a really nice surprise and how much
      they enjoyed her music. It was a pleasure having Yvonne join us on our
      special day.

  - quote: Yvonne has made our church’s piano “sing” in a way we’ve never
      experienced before. With incredible musicality, she offers us postlude
